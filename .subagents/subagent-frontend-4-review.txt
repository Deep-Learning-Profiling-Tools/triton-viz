Your task is frontend-4.
Follow these instructions: Review frontend-4 on branch cr/frontend-4 against the plan and acceptance. Check docs for terminology consistency with GLOSSARY.md. If issues, write reviews/frontend-4-round-1.md with BLOCKING/NIT/QUESTION tags and move task back to review-fix-backlog. If approved, move task to integrator-backlog. Output COMPLETED on success.

# Protocol

### Canonical task tracker
- `tasks/` is the **single source of truth** for tasks, status, ownership, dependencies, and coordination metadata.
- Task state is defined by directory:
  - `tasks/todo/` pending, unplanned
  - `tasks/code-backlog/` planned or in-progress coding work
  - `tasks/review-backlog/` awaiting review
  - `tasks/review-fix-backlog/` awaiting review fixes
  - `tasks/integrator-backlog/` approved, awaiting merge
  - `tasks/done/` merged and complete

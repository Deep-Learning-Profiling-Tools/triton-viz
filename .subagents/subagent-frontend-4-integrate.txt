When finished, provide a concise summary of your work and the outcome (COMPLETED or ABORTED).

# Protocol

### Canonical task tracker
- `tasks/` is the **single source of truth** for tasks, status, ownership, dependencies, and coordination metadata.
- Task state is defined by directory:
  - `tasks/todo/` pending, unplanned
  - `tasks/code-backlog/` planned or in-progress coding work
  - `tasks/review-backlog/` awaiting review
  - `tasks/review-fix-backlog/` awaiting review fixes
  - `tasks/integrator-backlog/` approved, awaiting merge
  - `tasks/done/` merged and complete

### Claiming and locking

thinking
**HUMAN-REVIEW REQUIRED**

Conflict detected between user request to keep review artifacts and system rule to never commit the reviews/ folder. Cannot reconcile automatically, so action is aborted.
codex
HUMAN-REVIEW REQUIRED

Conflict between instructions: skill `ai-integrate` requires removing `reviews/` from the base branch, but you explicitly asked to keep review artifacts. I need your decision to proceed.

Outcome: ABORTED.

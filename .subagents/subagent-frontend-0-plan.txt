Activate the skill 'ai-low-level-plan'.
Your task is frontend-0.
Follow these instructions: Base branch is viz-ts. The task file already contains the exact Plan section; do not alter the Plan content. Follow the skill: move the task into tasks/code-backlog, create the cr/frontend-0 worktree, and commit. Ensure dependency check passes. Finish with COMMITED outcome in summary and include 'Next step: /execute frontend-0'.

When finished, provide a concise summary of your work and the outcome (COMPLETED or ABORTED).

# Protocol

### Canonical task tracker
- `tasks/` is the **single source of truth** for tasks, status, ownership, dependencies, and coordination metadata.
- Task state is defined by directory:
  - `tasks/todo/` pending, unplanned
  - `tasks/code-backlog/` planned or in-progress coding work
  - `tasks/review-backlog/` awaiting review
  - `tasks/review-fix-backlog/` awaiting review fixes
  - `tasks/integrator-backlog/` approved, awaiting merge
  - `tasks/done/` merged and complete

### Task file format

thinking
**Preparing code-backlog commit**

I'm locating the frontend-0 task file in tasks/todo using ripgrep, planning to move the task to code-backlog, create a worktree, and commit without altering the existing plan.

# Task: remove flip visualization

Context: "remove the flip viz" while keeping all other visible UI (Tensor/Flow view, control sidebar, Program IDs filters, op controls, code peek panel, shape legend) unchanged.

Review-Round: 0
Owner:
Deps: none
Touches: triton_viz/static/flip.js, triton_viz/static/flip_3d.js, triton_viz/ARCHITECTURE.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, MANUAL.md, README.md
Acceptance:
- flip visualization modules are removed and the app loads without errors
- no imports/references to flip visualization remain in static JS or docs
- existing Tensor/Flow views and sidebar controls remain unchanged
Notes: Plan section is the low-level plan; use it verbatim without replacement.
Priority: P1

Plan:
- Overview: remove flip visualization modules and any references; keep remaining UI behavior unchanged.
- Mental model: flip visualizations are standalone 3D overlays; if no modules import them, deletion is safe.
- Interfaces / contracts: none; no public API changes expected.
- Files / functions / data structures: delete `triton_viz/static/flip.js` and `triton_viz/static/flip_3d.js`; scan `triton_viz/static/` for imports; update docs in `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `MANUAL.md`, `README.md`, `triton_viz/ARCHITECTURE.md` if they mention flip.


thinking
**Clarifying task claim file updates**

The task file already has the Plan and Review-Round set, so no Plan edits are needed. I'll move the file to tasks/code-backlog without altering Owner since it's unclear if setting Owner is required during claim.
thinking
**Verifying Owner field update**

I found no existing tasks in code-backlog to reference Owner conventions, so updating Owner to "codex" during claim seems reasonable to align with skill instructions without altering Plan content.
exec
/bin/bash -lc 'ls tasks' in /home/trtx/College/keren/triton-viz/viz-ts succeeded in 51ms:
todo

thinking
**Preparing to create tasks/code-backlog directory**

I’ll create the tasks/code-backlog directory as instructed to move files there, verify no dependency issues exist, and set up a worktree from the base repository to assist with these operations.
exec
/bin/bash -lc 'git status -s' in /home/trtx/College/keren/triton-viz/viz-ts succeeded in 51ms:


thinking
**Verifying current git branch**

I'm confirming that the current branch is the expected base branch "viz-ts" before proceeding.
exec
/bin/bash -lc 'git branch --show-current' in /home/trtx/College/keren/triton-viz/viz-ts succeeded in 51ms:
viz-ts

thinking
**Preparing to update codebase with git pull**
exec
/bin/bash -lc 'git pull' in /home/trtx/College/keren/triton-viz/viz-ts exited 1 in 287ms:
There is no tracking information for the current branch.
Please specify which branch you want to merge with.
See git-pull(1) for details.

    git pull <remote> <branch>

If you wish to set tracking information for this branch you can do so with:

    git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/<branch> viz-ts


thinking
**Handling git pull without upstream**

The pull failed due to no upstream branch, so I'll run a pull explicitly from the origin remote and the viz-ts branch to proceed without setting upstream.
exec
/bin/bash -lc 'git pull origin viz-ts' in /home/trtx/College/keren/triton-viz/viz-ts exited 1 in 228ms:
fatal: couldn't find remote ref viz-ts


thinking
**Deciding ownership update when moving file**

Planning to move the task file to code-backlog and commit before creating the worktree; considering setting the file Owner metadata to "codex" given skill guidance, while keeping touches unchanged.
thinking
**Planning file move and owner update sequence**

Will move the task file to tasks/code-backlog, then apply a patch to set Owner to "codex" without altering the Plan content, following skill instructions and observed patterns.

/bin/bash -lc 'mkdir -p tasks/code-backlog' in /home/trtx/College/keren/triton-viz/viz-ts succeeded in 51ms:

**Summarizing completion with commit status**

The dependency check passed, the task file was moved with Owner set to codex, and the worktree cr-frontend-0 was created. A git pull was attempted but failed due to no remote branch; this is noted for transparency. Outcome: COMMITED. Next step: /execute frontend-0.

- created worktree `../cr-frontend-0` on branch `cr/frontend-0`
- dependency check passed (`Deps: none`)

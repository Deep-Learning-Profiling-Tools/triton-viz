Activate the skill 'ai-low-level-plan'.
Your task is frontend-1.
Follow these instructions: Base branch is viz-ts. The task file already contains the exact Plan section; do not alter the Plan content. Follow the skill: move the task into tasks/code-backlog, create the cr/frontend-1 worktree, and commit. Ensure dependency check passes (frontend-0 is done). Finish with COMMITED outcome and include 'Next step: /execute frontend-1'.

When finished, provide a concise summary of your work and the outcome (COMPLETED or ABORTED).

# Protocol

### Canonical task tracker
- `tasks/` is the **single source of truth** for tasks, status, ownership, dependencies, and coordination metadata.
- Task state is defined by directory:
  - `tasks/todo/` pending, unplanned
  - `tasks/code-backlog/` planned or in-progress coding work
  - `tasks/review-backlog/` awaiting review
  - `tasks/review-fix-backlog/` awaiting review fixes
  - `tasks/integrator-backlog/` approved, awaiting merge
  - `tasks/done/` merged and complete

### Task file format

thinking
**Locating task file and verifying dependencies**

I'm identifying the task file for frontend-1 and checking that frontend-0 dependency is complete before proceeding. Next, I'll list available tasks to confirm filenames.

/bin/bash -lc 'ls tasks' in /home/trtx/College/keren/triton-viz/viz-ts succeeded in 51ms:

# Task: remove grid overview UI, keep active program workflow

Context: remove the click-to-open grid UI; default to opening program (0,0,0) and keep the Tensor/Flow views, control sidebar (Program IDs filters X/Y/Z, op controls, code peek panel), and shape legend unchanged.

Review-Round: 0
Owner:
Deps: [frontend-0]
Touches: triton_viz/static/visualization.js, triton_viz/static/gridblock.js, triton_viz/templates/index.html, triton_viz/static/visualizer.css, triton_viz/ARCHITECTURE.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, MANUAL.md, README.md
Acceptance:
- no grid overview canvas or click-to-open grid remains in the UI
- program (0,0,0) opens by default and Program IDs sliders update the active program
- op tabs, Tensor View, Flow View, code peek, and shape legend still work
Notes: Plan section is the low-level plan; use it verbatim without replacement.
Priority: P0

Plan:
- Overview: replace grid overview rendering with a lightweight active program controller that drives the op workspace directly.
- Mental model: the grid canvas and block UI are only for selection; the detail workspace and op visualizers are the real UI to preserve.
- Interfaces / contracts: preserve `visualization_data` key format and existing DOM IDs; keep code panel hooks until refactor.
- Files / functions / data structures: refactor `triton_viz/static/visualization.js` to remove KernelGrid; extract op workspace from `triton_viz/static/gridblock.js` into a new module (e.g., `op_workspace.js`); update `triton_viz/templates/index.html` and `triton_viz/static/visualizer.css` if canvas is removed.

thinking
**Moving task file without altering plan**

The current task file contains the exact Plan section and must be moved to the code-backlog without modifying that plan. I'll update metadata like owner or file locks if needed but strictly avoid changing the Plan content.
thinking
**Checking metadata in done tasks**

I'm inspecting done tasks to see how the Owner field is set, aiming to emulate the style for assigning ownership when moving the task file.
exec
/bin/bash -lc 'cat tasks/done/frontend-0_remove-flip-viz.md' in /home/trtx/College/keren/triton-viz/viz-ts succeeded in 51ms:
# Task: remove flip visualization

Context: "remove the flip viz" while keeping all other visible UI (Tensor/Flow view, control sidebar, Program IDs filters, op controls, code peek panel, shape legend) unchanged.

Review-Round: 2
Owner: codex
Deps: none
Touches: triton_viz/static/flip.js, triton_viz/static/flip_3d.js, triton_viz/ARCHITECTURE.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, MANUAL.md, README.md
Acceptance:
- flip visualization modules are removed and the app loads without errors
- no imports/references to flip visualization remain in static JS or docs
- existing Tensor/Flow views and sidebar controls remain unchanged
Notes: Plan section is the low-level plan; use it verbatim without replacement. review fix claimed. manual UI smoke test not run.
Priority: P1

Plan:
- Overview: remove flip visualization modules and any references; keep remaining UI behavior unchanged.
- Mental model: flip visualizations are standalone 3D overlays; if no modules import them, deletion is safe.
- Interfaces / contracts: none; no public API changes expected.
- Files / functions / data structures: delete `triton_viz/static/flip.js` and `triton_viz/static/flip_3d.js`; scan `triton_viz/static/` for imports; update docs in `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `MANUAL.md`, `README.md`, `triton_viz/ARCHITECTURE.md` if they mention flip.

thinking
**Confirming task move and branch setup**

Planning to move the task file into tasks/code-backlog, commit it on the base branch (viz-ts), and create a new git worktree with branch cr/frontend-1 as requested, verifying current branch status first.
exec
/bin/bash -lc 'git status -sb' in /home/trtx/College/keren/triton-viz/viz-ts succeeded in 51ms:
## viz-ts

thinking
**Pulling latest changes**

I'm updating the base branch by running a git pull as per instructions to ensure the latest changes are present.
exec
/bin/bash -lc 'git pull' in /home/trtx/College/keren/triton-viz/viz-ts exited 1 in 282ms:
There is no tracking information for the current branch.
Please specify which branch you want to merge with.
See git-pull(1) for details.

    git pull <remote> <branch>

If you wish to set tracking information for this branch you can do so with:

    git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/<branch> viz-ts


thinking
**Handling missing upstream and backlog setup**

The pull failed due to no upstream set; deciding to proceed without setting it since the skill didn't specify. Next, I'll check if the tasks/code-backlog directory exists to move the task file there.

Created worktree `../cr-frontend-1` on branch `cr/frontend-1` after confirming dependency `frontend-0` is done. Note: `git pull` skipped due to no upstream branch.

- Updated owner and moved task file to `tasks/code-backlog/frontend-1_remove-grid-overview.md`.
- Created worktree `../cr-frontend-1` on branch `cr/frontend-1`.
- Confirmed dependency `frontend-0` completed.

Outcome: COMMITED

-# Task: remove grid overview UI, keep active program workflow
-
-Context: remove the click-to-open grid UI; default to opening program (0,0,0) and keep the Tensor/Flow views, control sidebar (Program IDs filters X/Y/Z, op controls, code peek panel), and shape legend unchanged.
-
-Review-Round: 0
-Owner:
-Deps: [frontend-0]
-Touches: triton_viz/static/visualization.js, triton_viz/static/gridblock.js, triton_viz/templates/index.html, triton_viz/static/visualizer.css, triton_viz/ARCHITECTURE.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, MANUAL.md, README.md
-Acceptance:
-- no grid overview canvas or click-to-open grid remains in the UI
-- program (0,0,0) opens by default and Program IDs sliders update the active program
-- op tabs, Tensor View, Flow View, code peek, and shape legend still work
-Notes: Plan section is the low-level plan; use it verbatim without replacement.
-Priority: P0
-
-Plan:
-- Overview: replace grid overview rendering with a lightweight active program controller that drives the op workspace directly.
-- Mental model: the grid canvas and block UI are only for selection; the detail workspace and op visualizers are the real UI to preserve.
-- Interfaces / contracts: preserve `visualization_data` key format and existing DOM IDs; keep code panel hooks until refactor.
-- Files / functions / data structures: refactor `triton_viz/static/visualization.js` to remove KernelGrid; extract op workspace from `triton_viz/static/gridblock.js` into a new module (e.g., `op_workspace.js`); update `triton_viz/templates/index.html` and `triton_viz/static/visualizer.css` if canvas is removed.
-- Implementation steps:
-  - move op tab + visualization container logic into a reusable "op workspace" module
-  - implement active program selection that defaults to (0,0,0) and updates on Program IDs sliders
-  - remove grid drawing/hover/click code paths and any unused canvas DOM
-  - remove z-slider wiring (unused) and update sidebar control logic accordingly
-- Logging / observability: log program coordinate changes and op tab changes with program coord and op type.
-- Documentation: update `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `MANUAL.md`, `README.md`, and `triton_viz/ARCHITECTURE.md` to describe "Active Program" and remove grid/block terminology.
-- Tests: manual smoke test for default open, slider-driven op changes, tab switching, Tensor/Flow render, and code peek loading.
-- Risk analysis: risk of breaking op selection or code panel sync; mitigate by preserving data key parsing and reusing existing op rendering functions.

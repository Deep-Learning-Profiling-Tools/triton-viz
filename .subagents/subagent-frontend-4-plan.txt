Activate the skill 'ai-low-level-plan'.
Your task is frontend-4.
Follow these instructions: Create a concrete low-level plan for tasks/todo/frontend-4_docs-glossary.md. Move it to tasks/code-backlog with the plan filled in. Output COMPLETED on success.

When finished, provide a concise summary of your work and the outcome (COMPLETED or ABORTED).

# Protocol

### Canonical task tracker
- `tasks/` is the **single source of truth** for tasks, status, ownership, dependencies, and coordination metadata.
- Task state is defined by directory:
  - `tasks/todo/` pending, unplanned
  - `tasks/code-backlog/` planned or in-progress coding work
  - `tasks/review-backlog/` awaiting review
  - `tasks/review-fix-backlog/` awaiting review fixes
  - `tasks/integrator-backlog/` approved, awaiting merge
  - `tasks/done/` merged and complete

### Task file format

**Inspecting task file for dependencies**

frontend-4_docs-glossary.md

# Task: documentation overhaul with glossary

Context: document the frontend cleanly for AI agents by adding a canonical glossary and rewriting architecture/manual docs to match the UI and data flow.

Review-Round: 0
Owner:
Deps: [frontend-3]
Touches: GLOSSARY.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, MANUAL.md, README.md, triton_viz/ARCHITECTURE.md
Acceptance:
- GLOSSARY.md defines canonical UI terms, data types, and events
- ARCHITECTURE.md and MANUAL.md match the current UI and code structure
- README.md includes concise build/run guidance
Notes: Plan section is the low-level plan; use it verbatim without replacement.
Priority: P1

Plan:
- Overview: add a glossary and align all docs to the current UI, naming, and data flow.
- Mental model: ARCHITECTURE explains how it works; MANUAL explains how to use it; GLOSSARY anchors naming and term mapping.
- Interfaces / contracts: document public payload shapes and event names in the glossary and architecture docs.
- Files / functions / data structures: create `GLOSSARY.md`; rewrite `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `MANUAL.md`, `README.md`, and `triton_viz/ARCHITECTURE.md` to use glossary terms.

thinking
**Checking dependency completion**

I'm verifying that the frontend-3 dependency is marked done in the tasks/done directory before proceeding.
exec
/bin/bash -lc 'ls tasks/done' in /home/trtx/College/keren/triton-viz/main succeeded in 51ms:
frontend-0_remove-flip-viz.md
frontend-1_remove-grid-overview.md
frontend-2_architecture-patterns.md
frontend-3_ts-migration.md

thinking
**Preparing base branch and worktree setup**

I'll confirm the base branch (main), update it, move the file to code-backlog with a commit, and then add the new worktree for branching.
exec
/bin/bash -lc 'git status -s' in /home/trtx/College/keren/triton-viz/main succeeded in 51ms:


thinking
**Updating base to main and running**
exec
/bin/bash -lc 'git checkout main' in /home/trtx/College/keren/triton-viz/main succeeded in 51ms:
Already on 'main'
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 60 commits.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)

thinking
**Attempting git pull despite missing remote**
exec
/bin/bash -lc 'git pull' in /home/trtx/College/keren/triton-viz/main succeeded in 281ms:
Already up to date.


thinking
**Clarifying plan update approach**

The existing plan must be preserved verbatim without replacement, but the skill requires specific plan sections; to comply, I'll append the implementation plan details without removing the current plan, ensuring the task file meets the required structure.
thinking
**Confirming plan update sequencing**

I'll move and commit the task file with its current plan on the base branch first, then create a worktree to append the detailed implementation plan and commit that update separately.
exec
/bin/bash -lc 'git mv tasks/todo/frontend-4_docs-glossary.md tasks/code-backlog/frontend-4_docs-glossary.md' in /home/trtx/College/keren/triton-viz/main exited 128 in 51ms:

exec
/bin/bash -lc 'ls tasks/todo' in /home/trtx/College/keren/triton-viz/main succeeded in 51ms:
frontend-4_docs-glossary.md
frontend-5_dev-overlay.md

thinking
**Checking missing target path**

I'm verifying whether the move failed because the destination directory doesn't exist, as that would cause git mv to fail.
exec
/bin/bash -lc 'ls tasks' in /home/trtx/College/keren/triton-viz/main succeeded in 51ms:

**Creating missing code-backlog directory**

fatal: pathspec 'tasks/todo/frontend-4_docs-glossary.md' did not match any files

thinking
**Staging renamed and new files explicitly**

I'm using `git add -A` on the specific moved file path to stage the rename and new changes without relying on a blanket add.

**Creating new git worktree**

I'm adding a new worktree branch named for the frontend task to isolate development in a separate directory.

thinking
**Appending detailed plan sections**

I'm adding required plan parts after the existing plan bullets, covering logging/observability, docs update checks for ARCHITECTURE.md files in touched dirs, test coverage, risk analysis, and a doc checklist, using precise bullet formatting and minimal sentence detail.

+Plan: Logging / observability
+- Document every user action that emits logs (clicks, keyboard shortcuts, background tasks) and include expected payload keys or identifiers per action.
+
+Plan: Documentation
+- Ensure `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `MANUAL.md`, `README.md`, and `triton_viz/ARCHITECTURE.md` are updated and cross-linked, with `GLOSSARY.md` referenced as canonical.
+
+Plan: Tests
+- Add a doc checklist that verifies glossary terms match code identifiers and DOM `data-component` values, and confirm every user-facing feature listed in the manual is documented.
+
+Plan: Risk analysis
+- Parallel conflicts: other frontend tasks may edit docs or rename terms; mitigate by coordinating glossary ownership and reusing exact term strings.
+- Failure modes: inconsistent naming between docs and code or missing event payloads; mitigate with a final glossary-to-code audit pass.
+- Regression risk: users rely on MANUAL guidance; ensure removed or renamed UI features are reflected consistently across all docs.

+Plan: Overview
+- Restate acceptance: deliver a canonical `GLOSSARY.md`, align `ARCHITECTURE.md` and `MANUAL.md` with current UI/data flow, and add concise build/run guidance in `README.md`.
+
+Plan: Mental model
+- Treat `GLOSSARY.md` as the single source of truth for UI terminology, data types, and events; the architecture doc explains system structure while the manual focuses on user workflows.
+
+Plan: Interfaces / contracts
+- Enumerate public payload shapes, event names, and DOM `data-component` identifiers in the glossary, and reference them from architecture notes to keep terminology consistent.
+
+Plan: Files / functions / data structures
+- Create `GLOSSARY.md`; rewrite `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `MANUAL.md`, `README.md`, and `triton_viz/ARCHITECTURE.md` to adopt glossary terms and cross-links.
+- If any touched subdirectory lacks `ARCHITECTURE.md`, add it and summarize how it fits the glossary and system flow.
+
+Plan: Implementation steps
+- Audit current UI and data flow by scanning frontend sources to extract terms, DOM anchors, and event payloads for the glossary.
+- Draft `GLOSSARY.md` with categories (ui surfaces, components, data types, events) and explicit mappings to code identifiers.
+- Update `ARCHITECTURE.md` to describe module boundaries, data flow, and how glossary terms map to runtime structures.
+- Update `MANUAL.md` to describe only user-visible behaviors and controls, referencing glossary terms.
+- Update `README.md` with concise build/run steps and links to the glossary, architecture, and manual docs.

**Reconciling output with user and skill instructions**

I'll include the "Next step" line per the skill while also providing the requested summary, outcome, and COMPLETED notice, noting the moved file and new directory created.
codex
Next step: `/execute frontend-4`.

Added the required low-level plan sections and moved the task into the planning backlog, keeping the original plan intact while appending the detailed structure in `tasks/code-backlog/frontend-4_docs-glossary.md`.

Outcome: COMPLETED.

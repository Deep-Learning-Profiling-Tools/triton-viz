Activate the skill 'ai-review-fix'.
Your task is frontend-0.
Follow these instructions: Base branch is viz-ts. Apply review feedback in reviews/frontend-0-round-1.md. Remove the committed .subagents logs from the CR. Answer the smoke-test question by noting that a manual UI smoke test was not run (add a brief note in the task file when resubmitting). Keep scope limited to review items. Commit fixes and resubmit to review backlog.

When finished, provide a concise summary of your work and the outcome (COMPLETED or ABORTED).

# Protocol

### Canonical task tracker
- `tasks/` is the **single source of truth** for tasks, status, ownership, dependencies, and coordination metadata.
- Task state is defined by directory:
  - `tasks/todo/` pending, unplanned
  - `tasks/code-backlog/` planned or in-progress coding work
  - `tasks/review-backlog/` awaiting review
  - `tasks/review-fix-backlog/` awaiting review fixes
  - `tasks/integrator-backlog/` approved, awaiting merge
  - `tasks/done/` merged and complete

### Task file format

thinking
**Reviewing task files and preparing for cleanup**

I need to check the task file for frontend-0 in tasks/review-fix-backlog and review the feedback in reviews/frontend-0-round-1.md, then plan to remove committed .subagents logs from the change request. I'll start by listing the relevant task files.
exec
/bin/bash -lc 'ls tasks/review-fix-backlog' in /home/trtx/College/keren/triton-viz/cr-frontend-0 succeeded in 51ms:
frontend-0_remove-flip-viz.md

/bin/bash -lc 'cat tasks/review-fix-backlog/frontend-0_remove-flip-viz.md' in /home/trtx/College/keren/triton-viz/cr-frontend-0 succeeded in 51ms:
# Task: remove flip visualization

Context: "remove the flip viz" while keeping all other visible UI (Tensor/Flow view, control sidebar, Program IDs filters, op controls, code peek panel, shape legend) unchanged.

Review-Round: 1
Owner: codex
Deps: none
Touches: triton_viz/static/flip.js, triton_viz/static/flip_3d.js, triton_viz/ARCHITECTURE.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, MANUAL.md, README.md
Acceptance:
- flip visualization modules are removed and the app loads without errors
- no imports/references to flip visualization remain in static JS or docs
- existing Tensor/Flow views and sidebar controls remain unchanged
Notes: Plan section is the low-level plan; use it verbatim without replacement.
Priority: P1

Plan:
- Overview: remove flip visualization modules and any references; keep remaining UI behavior unchanged.
- Mental model: flip visualizations are standalone 3D overlays; if no modules import them, deletion is safe.
- Interfaces / contracts: none; no public API changes expected.
- Files / functions / data structures: delete `triton_viz/static/flip.js` and `triton_viz/static/flip_3d.js`; scan `triton_viz/static/` for imports; update docs in `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `MANUAL.md`, `README.md`, `triton_viz/ARCHITECTURE.md` if they mention flip.


thinking
**Considering owner update and commit**

The owner is already set to codex, so no change is needed there; to follow the skill's directive to commit after claiming, I'll consider adding a minimal note to trigger a meaningful commit without altering the main fields excessively.
thinking
**Planning minimal task file update for claim commit**

I'll add a small note like "review fix in progress" to the Notes field to justify the claim commit without changing the Owner, keeping within scope and following the skill’s requirements. Next, I'll review the feedback file for this round.
exec
/bin/bash -lc 'cat reviews/frontend-0-round-1.md' in /home/trtx/College/keren/triton-viz/cr-frontend-0 succeeded in 51ms:
# Review: frontend-0 round 1

BLOCKING: remove execution artifacts that are not part of the plan or acceptance criteria. delete `.subagents/subagent-frontend-0-execute.txt` and `.subagents/subagent-frontend-0-plan.txt` from the CR (optionally add `.subagents/` to `.gitignore` if these files should never be committed).

QUESTION: was a quick UI smoke test performed to confirm the app loads without errors and the Tensor/Flow views still open after deleting the flip viz modules?

**Planning file removals and task update**

Files matching .subagents and subagent*.txt are already ignored but need removal from git since they're still tracked. The plan includes deleting these files, verifying untracked status, and adding a note in the task file about skipping manual UI smoke tests upon resubmission.
exec
/bin/bash -lc 'git status -s' in /home/trtx/College/keren/triton-viz/cr-frontend-0 succeeded in 51ms:

**Adding claim note to task file**

I'm updating the task file to add a minimal "review fix claimed" note in the Notes section before committing, following the claim-before-implementation protocol.

-Plan:
-- Overview: remove flip visualization modules and any references; keep remaining UI behavior unchanged.
-- Mental model: flip visualizations are standalone 3D overlays; if no modules import them, deletion is safe.
-- Interfaces / contracts: none; no public API changes expected.
-- Files / functions / data structures: delete `triton_viz/static/flip.js` and `triton_viz/static/flip_3d.js`; scan `triton_viz/static/` for imports; update docs in `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `MANUAL.md`, `README.md`, `triton_viz/ARCHITECTURE.md` if they mention flip.
-- Implementation steps:
-  - remove flip JS files and any direct imports
-  - run a quick scan for "flip" references in static modules and docs
-  - verify template/CSS has no flip references
-- Logging / observability: no new user actions; ensure no flip-specific logging remains referenced.
-- Documentation: update `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `MANUAL.md`, `README.md`, and `triton_viz/ARCHITECTURE.md` to remove flip mentions.
-- Tests: manual smoke test the UI loads and Tensor/Flow views still open; confirm no 404s for deleted assets.
-- Risk analysis: low risk; primary risk is stray imports or doc drift; mitigate via search before deletion.

"""Two-copy symbolic HB solver.

Production race-finder for ``SymbolicRaceDetector``. The solver duplicates each
recorded access into two symbolic program-instances ``A`` and ``B`` (alpha-
renaming PIDs, ``tl.arange`` lane vars, and per-record copy-local vars such as
the CAS return), then asks Z3 whether any pair of cross-copy events is
unordered, in conflict, and aliasing.

Model boundary (closed-world atomic source assumption):
  When an initial scalar source is identifiable AND no unmodeled write (plain
  store or atomic RMW) can overlap the location, source choices are closed
  over: (initial source) + (modeled CAS writers in the two selected copies).
  Otherwise ``rf_unknown_R`` is introduced but does NOT enable a
  synchronizes-with edge — an overlapping plain-store/RMW can publish a value
  outside the closed world (e.g. a flag set via ``tl.atomic_xchg``), so the
  reader's old value must not be over-constrained or every conflict gated on
  it silently disappears. Synchronization through a third program instance is
  not modeled. The guarded acquire/release CAS no-race result depends on the
  closed world, which holds whenever the flag is only ever written by modeled
  CAS.

Address-domain invariant:
  ``record.addr_expr`` consumed by this solver MUST be a byte address matching
  ``tensor.data_ptr()``. ``byte_overlap`` and ``initial_atomic_source`` rely on
  this. Capture-side normalisation must convert element / tensor-relative
  offsets to byte addresses BEFORE the records reach the solver.

Intra-instance duplicate lanes:
  Cross-copy queries assert ``different_blocks``, so they can never witness
  two lanes of one store colliding inside a single program instance — and a
  grid=(1,1,1) launch makes ``different_blocks`` UNSAT outright. A separate
  same-instance query pins ``pid_a == pid_b`` and every launch-level
  copy-local var equal, leaving the arange lane vars as the only
  alpha-difference between the copies; requiring a lane-identity difference
  then asks whether two DISTINCT lanes of the same dynamic access conflict.

Z3 ``unknown`` policy:
  ``unknown`` is never treated as unsat. A race query that comes back
  undecided raises :class:`UnsupportedSymbolicRaceQuery` (the launch reports
  ``unsupported`` instead of a silent clean verdict), and an undecided
  overlap in the closed-world escape check opens the ``rf_unknown`` escape.

RMW value modeling (spec part B):
  An integer AtomicRMW with a modeled op (``add``/``max``/``min``/``xchg``)
  gets a fresh observation symbol ``o_r`` (``record.old_value``, alpha-
  renamed per copy exactly like the CAS return) and a modeled write part
  ``f_op(o_r, v)`` (``written_value``). ``o_r`` is justified like a CAS
  observation: rf candidates are the value-modeled atomic writers, the
  initial-value source, and the unknown source when an unmodeled writer can
  overlap. Value-modeled atomics join the per-location atomic order, which
  makes RMW **atomicity/immediacy** structural: one order position covers
  the read AND the write part, and the existing "no successful same-address
  writer strictly between rf source and reader" constraint is exactly the
  immediacy axiom. Two extensions build on it:

  - **Reads-through (release sequences over RMW chains)**: sw(w, r) also
    holds when r reads-through w via a bounded chain of modeled RMW write
    parts (each link an rf edge). Chains through UNMODELED grid instances
    are covered only by the counting axiom below.
  - **Counting axiom** (guarded): for a location L touched by EXACTLY ONE
    always-active scalar constant-increment ``add`` RMW record with a known
    initial value and no other possible writer, per-copy rank variables
    r ∈ [0, |G|) satisfy ``o = init + c·rank``, rank equality iff same
    block, and ``co ⇔ rank<``. Under those guards every write to L between
    two instances is a link of the same RMW chain, so reads-through is
    equivalent to coherence order — giving last-block-done and work-queue
    disjointness. A counted reader also gets an ``rf_chain`` source choice
    (an unmodeled instance at rank-1) so real races at non-adjacent ranks
    are not squeezed out of the closed world; ``rf_chain`` itself never
    enables synchronizes-with. If ANY guard fails the axiom is omitted
    entirely (over-report direction), and an observation variable used in
    an ADDRESS position without counting support raises
    ``UnsupportedSymbolicRaceQuery`` instead of widening silently.

Limitations (current):
  - **Initial atomic source covers scalar tensors and small contiguous flag
    arrays** (``numel <= _MAX_INITIAL_ATOMIC_ELEMENTS = 1024``). Larger or
    non-contiguous tensors fall through to ``rf_unknown_R``, which
    deliberately does NOT enable synchronizes-with; guarded acq/rel CAS over
    them is reported as races conservatively.
  - **Two program instances only** — synchronization that travels through a
    third block (writer-via-third-block CAS chains) is not modeled directly;
    the counting axiom is the one guarded exception.
  - **Float-typed RMW returns and bitwise/unsigned RMW ops are not value-
    modeled** (``fadd``, float max, ``and``/``or``/``xor``, ``umax``/
    ``umin``): the capture keeps the downstream-use sentinel / DataDep
    fallback, and the record's write stays in the unmodeled-writer set.
  - **Atomic CAS/RMW inside loops are unsupported** — they are eagerly
    captured today (no integration with the loop-pending path), so the
    handlers mark the launch unsupported instead of recording phantom
    events.

    def _build_value_causality_constraints(self) -> None:
        """wf-vc: value-causality axiom (no out-of-thin-air values).

        Rationale (PTX causality / Tile-IR no-thin-air): the hardware
        memory model never lets a relaxed atomic load observe a value whose
        only justification is a write that itself depends on that very
        observation — two relaxed reads each observing the value the other
        thread's dependent write produced is forbidden even without any
        acquire/release ordering. Formally the model requires rf ∪ vdep to
        be acyclic, where vdep(r, e) holds when read r's observation
        reaches event e's written value, operand, activity, or address.

        Encoding: every value-modeled atomic event e (the per-location
        atomic-order membership set) gets a PAIR of fresh Int causality
        ranks vc_r(e) <= vc_w(e) — value flows read-to-write within one
        operation, which also orders an identity write-back after its own
        observation. Two edge families then rule the cycles out:

          * rf edge: for each MODELED-writer selector rf(w, r), assert
            rf(w, r) -> vc_w(w) < vc_r(r): a read's value exists only
            after its source write produced it. rf_init / rf_unknown /
            rf_chain sources get NO edge — a reader sourced there has an
            unconstrained vc_r and roots the graph, so cycles through the
            initial value, the open world, or the counted chain are NOT
            excluded (conservative: those values may be justified outside
            the two modeled copies).
          * static vdep edge: if r's observation symbol occurs in another
            value-modeled event e's written value or RMW operand (a CAS's
            cmp/new terms live inside its written_value If-term), assert
            vc_r(r) < vc_w(e); if it occurs in e's activity (reads/writes
            exprs) or address, assert vc_r(r) < vc_r(e) — the value is
            needed before e's read part can even issue.

        Gating: vdep edges are asserted UNCONDITIONALLY, unlike co-hb's
        activity gating. Syntactic dependence is a static fact; the static
        vdep graph is acyclic by construction (a record's lowered terms can
        only mention observation symbols captured earlier in its own copy,
        and alpha-renaming separates the copies), so the vdep edges alone
        are always satisfiable, and every cycle-closing rf edge is already
        activity-gated through its selector (_build_read_from_choices
        forces all selectors false when the reader is inactive). An
        activity gate would only weaken the axiom without excluding any
        additional execution.

        Occurrence is checked on GENUINE observation symbols only: the keys
        of r.old_value intersected with the copy-local rename targets (the
        observation vars live in copy_local_vars, like the CAS return).
        Anything that leaks other vars into old_value yields an empty key
        set and simply drops the vdep edge — the over-report direction.

        Plain stores and non-value-modeled atomics carry no ranks: a
        causality cycle through them would need an rf edge FROM them, which
        the closed world never provides (they open the rf_unknown escape
        instead), so their omission is conservative.

        """Per-copy rank variables for each RMW record whose guards hold.

        Guards, all checked on the TEMPLATE (Z3 ``unknown`` fails a guard —
        the axiom is then OMITTED, never approximated):
          (a) the record is a value-modeled ``add`` RMW with exactly one
              lane per copy, and its address simplifies to ONE numeral in
              both copies (a fixed scalar location L);
          (b) its activity is provably true for every instance;
          (c) the increment is a constant c > 0;
          (d) L's initial value is known via the rf-init machinery's own
              side conditions;
          (e) no OTHER event's write part can overlap L (which also keeps
              the rf_unknown escape closed for the counted readers).
        The grid-size product must stay linear: at most one symbolic dim.

        Justification of the emitted constraints: under (a)-(e) every write
        to L is an instance of this one always-active RMW, so the
        per-location coherence order is exactly the arrival order; the k-th
        arriver observes init + c·k (induction over the chain, using
        atomicity/immediacy), distinct instances have distinct ranks, and
        coherence order agrees with rank order. Consequences the solver
        derives for free: distinct observations across blocks (work-queue
        disjointness) and "o = init + c·(|G|-1) forces coherence-after-
        everyone" (last-block-done).

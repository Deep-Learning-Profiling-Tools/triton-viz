"""The compiled sanitizer client (``Sanitizer(compile=True)``).

An ``IRClient`` that reads each compiled config's TTIR and checks the
launch against it with ``oob.check_graph``, without running the kernel
(``LAUNCH = "skip"``, D2): output tensors are left untouched, and addresses
are the launch's tensor addresses. The TTIR is compiled on the host for the
client's target (D25, D26: ``target=``, else ``TILELENS_IR_TARGET``, else
``cuda:89``), so no GPU is needed and a result never depends on the machine:
CPU tensors are checked like device ones.

Every config the launch compiled is checked, autotune benchmark configs
included (D3), each against the bindings the core delivered for it, and
gets its own ``ConfigVerdict``: configs that compile to one kernel but bind
other runtime arguments or grids are checked and reported apart (D22).

A config that failed to compile never fails the launch (D27): the target is
this client's choice, not the machine's. What the failure means (see
_compiles_nowhere):

- an error no target compiles past (a failing ``tl.static_assert``, a Python
  construct Triton's code generator never accepts), from a compile that
  never asked Triton's driver anything (nor did an earlier compile of the
  kernel for the target, whose answer the kernel's code may keep): the
  config never launches anywhere (Triton's autotuner drops it too), so it
  is only noted;
- any other compile error may be the target's (``num_ctas > 1`` below
  cuda:90, an fp8 type the target lacks, 16-bit descriptor atomic min/max
  without native TMA, ...): the config may launch on the user's GPU and was
  not checked, so it is unsupported, kind ``"compile-failed"``, with a
  refusal naming the target and how to name another;
- a call that does not bind the kernel's parameters (a missing, extra or
  misnamed argument) is no compile failure: the core raises the JIT
  binder's error from the launch, as the untraced call raises it on any GPU
  (D28), so it never reaches this client from a traced launch; one
  delivered anyway (an event built outside the core) is unsupported, kind
  ``"compile-failed"``, naming no other target, which would not help;
- a host compile that could not run at all (Triton's compile API, or a
  compile that asked for a device: ``HostCompileUnavailable``; or one
  refused while an interpreted traced launch has the language patched:
  ``LanguagePatchedError``) says nothing about the kernel: unsupported,
  kind ``"host-compile-unavailable"``.

Each refusal and note names where the kernel failed (``file:line`` of the
kernel's code the error points at, else of its ``def``) and the innermost
error in one line; the whole error stays on the ArtifactLog's
CompileFailure. A launch no config of which compiled is unsupported, with
the first failed config's refusal (``"compile-failed"`` when every config
was only noted; its notes are printed with it).
The launch's status is the union: ``"violations"`` if any config has a
finding, else ``"unsupported"`` if any config was not (fully) checked, else
``"ok"``. Nothing is ``"ok"`` before a check says so.

What ``"ok"`` covers (``IRVerdict.scope == "launch"``): this launch, with
the scalar arguments, grid and tensors it was called with, as compiled for
the target (a kernel's TTIR can differ between targets, e.g. for tensor
descriptors below sm90). Since no kernel
runs, its outputs are never written: a later launch whose arguments the
host computes from them (a count, an offset, a size read back) is checked
with the values the untraced program would not have used, so a program's
launches can each be "ok" while the untraced program goes out of bounds.
In a trace shared with an eager client that runs the interpreter (D4b), the
interpreted run happens before this analysis, unchecked by it.

A check is remembered: a later launch of the same compiled kernel with the
same scalar arguments, grid, and tensor shapes, strides and element sizes
(only the addresses differ, as in a training loop) reuses it, with the
findings' addresses moved to the new tensors.

Each finding becomes a ``CompiledSanitizerRecord``; the launch's
``IRVerdict`` follows them in ``Launch.records`` (D5). With
``abort_on_error`` every finding is printed as this client finalizes the
launch, which then raises ``SystemExit(1)``: the core still finalizes the
trace's other clients and exits after them, but the launch keeps none of
this client's records and is not added to ``tilelens.launches``. On a host
thread other than the main one the exit ends only that thread (the
process's exit status is unchanged). Without ``abort_on_error`` findings
are printed only under ``TILELENS_VERBOSE=1``. The parts of a launch that
were not checked are printed alongside, each op once per client and
compiled kernel (a kernel launched in a loop would repeat them).

"""The compiled sanitizer's per-launch checks over an AccessGraph.

Given a kernel's ``AccessGraph`` (``tilelens.ir.ttir_reader``) and one
launch's ``LaunchBinding``, each access becomes a few Z3 queries over the
launch's free variables (program ids, the access's lane positions, the
loop's iteration index), with its scalar arguments and grid substituted as
constants:

* ``out-of-bounds`` (D12): the access executes (its loop runs, its path and
  mask hold) at an element offset outside the view footprint of its
  tensor, the eager sanitizer's legal set: the offsets
  ``sum(i_d * stride_d)`` with ``0 <= i_d < size_d``, a stride-0 dim
  counting once, relative to the view's ``data_ptr``;
* ``integer-overflow`` (D9): a width obligation the access depends on can
  fail, so the IR's fixed-width arithmetic is not the unbounded reading;
* ``division-by-zero`` (D21): a ``//`` or ``%`` the access reaches (from its
  offset, mask or path, or from its loop's bounds) can divide by zero.

The unbounded reading of a term is exact only where the obligations below
it hold and its divisors are non-zero. The reader's roles order that
dependence: the loop's bounds, then its increment (only when the loop
runs), then the access's path, its mask (under the path) and its offset
(under path and mask). Each role is discharged by ONE query, "some
obligation or division of this role fails", under the safety of the roles
before it and never under its own (a wrap can decide a sibling divisor, and
the reverse); the out-of-bounds query assumes every role's safety. A
wrapped offset is therefore an integer overflow, never an out-of-bounds
witness that only the unbounded reading has.

A value in an arm of a ``Select`` (``tl.where``) matters only where the
select picks that arm, so the width obligations of the access's path, mask
and offset are discharged under the conditions of the arms their terms are
read through: a wrap the select discards is harmless (``arith`` ops wrap,
with defined results). Divisions are not: the IR computes both arms, and a
zero divisor (or ``INT_MIN // -1``) in the discarded one is still
undefined, so they are checked wherever the access evaluates them. (The
loop's own obligations are always checked unguarded.)

Lanes: every tensor one access's terms combine has the access's shape
(TTIR broadcasts explicitly, and only size-1 dims), so all aranges along
one dim index the same position there: an arange's value is its start plus
the lane position of its dim (one position per dim and extent; an extent-1
arange broadcast along a longer dim stays at position 0).

Findings are exact: a SAT model is a concrete launch state, and the op a
role reports is the innermost one failing in the model (so one wrap is not
reported at the ops computed from it). A model that may be unreachable is
withheld and the access *abstains* instead (D21's list kept from #361): a
branch condition the reader could not model (``guarded``) or one reading an
atomic observation, a mask it dropped (``mask_dropped``) or one reading an
observation. Z3's ``unknown`` abstains too (D11), each query on a fresh
Solver with its own timeout, so whether a hard query ends in
``solver-unknown`` can depend on the machine's load. An access the model
cannot check at all is refused (an unbound argument, a non-positive loop
step, an address that depends on an atomic observation). Abstentions never
suppress another access's findings: a ``CheckResult`` carries both, and
only one with neither is a proof for the launch.

Each check builds its Z3 terms in a Z3 context of its own, so checks may
run on several host threads at once (one Z3 context is not thread-safe). A
Ctrl+C that Z3 caught during a query is raised as ``KeyboardInterrupt``,
never taken for an unknown.

Terms are lowered by the shared ``tilelens.ir.lowering`` (the reader's
operator semantics) with ``_Env`` as its leaves: the launch's constants, and
the free variables above with their range premises. Terms can be deeper
than Python's recursion limit and their generated ``==`` / ``hash``
recurse, so the walks over them are iterative and keyed by term identity.

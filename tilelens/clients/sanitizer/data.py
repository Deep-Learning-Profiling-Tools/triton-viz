        constraints (z3.z3.BoolRef | None):
            A conjunction of Z3 constraint expressions defining valid ranges
            for memory access. Any address falling outside these ranges is considered invalid.

        violation_address (int):
            The exact address where an invalid memory access was detected.
            For example:
            Invalid access detected at index: 200

            A few simplified constraints might look like:
              And(x >= 50, x <= 60, x != 55)
              And(x >= 70, x <= 80)
              ...

            In this scenario, 200 is an out-of-bounds address because it
            falls outside the valid ranges described by these constraints.

        symbolic_expr (Any | None):
            The symbolic expression tree that led to the OOB access, if available.

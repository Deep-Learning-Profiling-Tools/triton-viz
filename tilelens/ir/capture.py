"""Per-launch compiled artifacts, and a content-addressed parse cache (the L2 layer).

``ArtifactLog`` records what the core's IR hooks delivered during one traced
launch: per compiled specialization its declared IR stages and compile
metadata plus the LaunchBindings seen for it, and every compile failure.
``ParseCache`` runs a reader once per distinct text and keeps what it gave,
a graph or a typed refusal, so a refusal's kind survives cache hits.

Mechanism only: which specialization counts, what an absent stage means and
what a refusal or an error becomes are the client's calls. Neither class
raises for a bad kernel, text or reader.

Importing this module does not import Triton or the TTIR reader.

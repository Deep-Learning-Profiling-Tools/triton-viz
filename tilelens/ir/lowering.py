"""Term -> Z3 lowering shared by the compiled-mode clients (D13).

The one reading of the TTIR reader's term algebra (``ttir_reader``'s
``Term``) as Z3 integers and booleans, for every client that queries an
``AccessGraph`` with Z3. Mechanism only: the operator semantics live here,
every leaf's meaning comes from the client. A client's :class:`TermLeaves`
says what a scalar argument, a program id, the grid, a lane, a loop's
iteration, an atomic observation and an unmodeled value are, and a client
that cannot model a leaf raises its own exception from it, which propagates
unchanged. The lowering itself raises only on a malformed graph, a bug and
never a limit of the model: ``TypeError`` or ``ValueError`` for a term or op
outside the algebra, or for a ``LoopVar`` (or an ``IterArgOffset`` whose
IterArgInfo names no loop) in a graph without a loop, and ``IndexError`` for
an ``arg_id`` outside ``iter_args``.

Operator semantics, the reader's integer model (see ``ttir_reader``):

* ``+ - *`` are unbounded Int arithmetic; ``//`` and ``%`` truncate toward
  zero (``arith.divsi`` / ``remsi``: the remainder takes the dividend's
  sign); ``min`` / ``max`` pick an operand;
* the unsigned ops (``u//``, ``u%``, ``umin``, ``umax``) and predicates
  (``ult``, ...) read as their signed twins, and an ``IntCast`` as its
  operand: exact only where the access's ``width_obligations`` hold, which
  the client discharges (a zero divisor is the client's concern too);
* an i1 value is a Bool in a boolean position (a mask or path, a Select's
  condition, ``and`` / ``or`` / negation) and 0/1 in an integer one, and a
  Select whose arms differ in sort is an Int;
* ``LoopVar`` is ``lower + k * step`` and ``IterArgOffset`` is ``offset0 +
  k * delta``, with ``k`` the client's iteration of that loop.

Z3 context: the lowering never creates one. Constants are made in
``leaves.ctx`` (None: Z3's main context) and every other term in its
operands' context, so all of a client's terms share the context of its
leaves (the compiled sanitizer's is a Context per check).

Terms can be deeper than Python's recursion limit and their generated
``==`` / ``hash`` recurse, so the walk is iterative and memoized by term
identity.

"""TTIR reader shared by the compiled-mode clients.

Reads the pre-optimization Triton IR (TTIR) of one kernel specialization
into an ``AccessGraph``: the kernel's function arguments, every global
memory access (``tt.load`` / ``tt.store`` / ``tt.atomic_rmw`` /
``tt.atomic_cas``) as an *element offset* expression relative to a base
pointer argument, the mask guarding it, and the loop structure. Scalar
arguments (``n_elements``, ``M``, strides, ...) stay symbolic (``Param``
nodes) and are substituted with concrete launch values later;
``tl.constexpr`` values are already folded into TTIR constants.

Why TTIR (not TTGIR): element addressing is cleanest here, before
layouts/pipelining add noise, and TTIR has no indirect loads unless the
kernel itself gathers — the data-dependent case, marked with ``DataDep``.

This module is mechanism-only: it reads and flags (``DataDep`` markers,
``guarded`` accesses, width obligations, ``UnsupportedTTIR``); what to do
about a flagged or unsupported kernel is the policy of each client that
consumes the graph. It either represents the IR faithfully or raises an
``UnsupportedTTIR`` whose ``kind`` says what it cannot represent.

Structure comes from ``_mlir_walk`` (the MLIR bindings plus the aligned
text layer): the reader walks its op tree over regions and blocks, and its
environment is keyed by the walk's value indices, never by printed SSA
names. Ported from the #361 regex reader (``parse_ttir(multipath=False)``;
the layout below stays diffable with it), with the audit's soundness fixes
built in: loop-variant and swapped pointer advances, ``tt.call``,
graph-aware observation walkers, integer widths and casts (D9), and inline
asm that is impure or handed an address.

Address model: ``tt.addptr(base, off)`` accumulates an ELEMENT offset; the
byte address is ``base.data_ptr() + offset * elem_size``. An access is OOB
iff, for some program id / arange lane / loop iteration with its mask true,
the element offset escapes ``[0, numel)`` of its base tensor.

Integer model (D9): every integer term denotes the IR value's SIGNED
reading as an unbounded integer (i1 terms are booleans, 0/1). That reading
is exact while the ``width_obligations`` of the access hold (they include
the loop's own increment); a consumer that evaluates terms with unbounded
integers must discharge (or report) them. ``Param`` values are the IR's
signed reading of the argument too. Division or remainder by zero is
undefined in the IR rather than a width condition, and so is an scf.for
step that is not positive: no obligation excludes them, that is the
consumer's call.

Terms are frozen dataclasses with the generated ``==`` / ``hash`` /
``repr``, which recurse: on a term deeper than Python's recursion limit
(``kernel_deep_chain`` has more than 1000 levels) they, and
``copy.deepcopy``, raise ``RecursionError``; only ``pickle`` and this
module's own walkers are iterative. Consumers of such graphs key memo
tables by identity.

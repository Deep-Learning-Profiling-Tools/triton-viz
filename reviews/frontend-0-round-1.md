# Review: frontend-0 round 1

BLOCKING: remove execution artifacts that are not part of the plan or acceptance criteria. delete `.subagents/subagent-frontend-0-execute.txt` and `.subagents/subagent-frontend-0-plan.txt` from the CR (optionally add `.subagents/` to `.gitignore` if these files should never be committed).

QUESTION: was a quick UI smoke test performed to confirm the app loads without errors and the Tensor/Flow views still open after deleting the flip viz modules?

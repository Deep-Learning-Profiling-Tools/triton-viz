Welcome to TileLens, a visualization and profiling toolkit designed for deep learning applications. Built with the intention of making kernel programming in tile-based DSLs like Triton more intuitive.

Visit our [site](https://deep-learning-profiling-tools.github.io/tilelens/) to see our tool in action!

## About

TileLens helps developers inspect Triton kernels with visualization, profiling, and memory-safety analysis tools. It can run many examples through Triton's interpreter, so GPU access is not required for basic debugging workflows.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python >= 3.10


### Installation of TileLens

> **Windows Note:** TileLens depends on Triton, which can only be installed on Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). Once installed, follow below instructions in WSL.

Install TileLens from PyPI:

```sh
pip install tilelens
```

If you want to run examples from this repo, contribute, or build the web UI, install from source instead:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Deep-Learning-Profiling-Tools/tilelens.git
cd tilelens
uv sync # or "uv sync --extra test" if you're running tests
```

### Transitioning from Triton-viz to TileLens

The GitHub repo and PyPI package are now named `tilelens`. Use `import tilelens`
in new code. Old `triton_viz` imports, including submodule imports, still work.

If you already have `triton-viz` installed, uninstall it before installing
TileLens. The two packages share files, so keeping both installed can break
imports and CLI commands:

```sh
pip uninstall -y triton-viz
pip install tilelens
```

For source installs, use `pip install .` after uninstalling the old package.
If you already installed both, uninstall `triton-viz` first, then run
`pip install --force-reinstall tilelens` (or `pip install --force-reinstall .`
from this repo). Restart Python or your notebook kernel after upgrading.

Existing `.tvz` traces can still be loaded with `tilelens.load(...)`.
Traces saved by TileLens cannot be loaded by older Triton-Viz versions.

CLI commands are `tile-sanitizer`, `tile-profiler`, `tile-race-detector`, and `tile-visualizer`.
The old `triton-*` commands still work.

### Web UI Build

The PyPI package ships with prebuilt web UI assets in `tilelens/static`, so
you do not need npm to run the visualizer. If you want to modify the web UI,
rebuild the TS sources:

```sh
npm install
npm run build:frontend
```

### Optional: Enable NKI Support

For PyPI installs, install with the `nki` extra and AWS Neuron repository:

```sh
pip install "tilelens[nki]" --extra-index-url https://pip.repos.neuron.amazonaws.com
```

For source installs:

```sh
uv sync --extra nki # or "uv sync --extra nki --extra test" if also running NKI-related tests
```

Note that you need to specify all features that you want _in one statement_ when using `uv sync`, i.e. if you want both NKI and testing support, you must run `uv sync --extra nki --extra test`. The below statements are wrong and will remove the NKI install when installing test packages:
```
uv sync --extra nki # NKI support but no testing
uv sync --extra test # tests but no NKI support
```

### Testing
* To run core TileLens tests, run `pytest tests/`.
* (if NKI installed) To run NKI-specific tests, run `pytest tests/ -m nki`.
* To run all tests (Triton + NKI), run `pytest tests/ -m ""`.
* To run visualizer web UI tests, run `npm run test:frontend`.

## Working with Examples

Run an example directly with Python:

```sh
python examples/visualizer/matmul.py
```

Use the decorator API when writing or modifying a Triton kernel:

```py
import triton
import triton.language as tl
import tilelens


@tilelens.trace("sanitizer")  # also supports "tracer" and "profiler"
@triton.jit
def kernel(x_ptr, out_ptr, BLOCK: tl.constexpr):
    offsets = tl.arange(0, BLOCK)
    values = tl.load(x_ptr + offsets)
    tl.store(out_ptr + offsets, values)
```

Use the CLI wrappers to run an existing Python script without editing it. These
wrappers patch plain `@triton.jit` kernels, so use them with scripts that do not
already apply `@tilelens.trace(...)`.

```sh
tile-sanitizer examples/sanitizer/oob_cli.py
tile-profiler examples/profiler/load_store_cli.py
tile-visualizer trace.tvz
```

For visualizer workflows, save a trace and launch the UI from Python:

```py
import tilelens

tilelens.save("trace.tvz")
tilelens.launch()
```

## DSL Frontends

Triton is the default DSL frontend. NKI support is optional and selected with
the `frontend` argument:

```py
tilelens.trace("tracer")  # Triton
tilelens.trace("tracer", frontend="nki")  # NKI
tilelens.trace("tracer", frontend="nki_beta2")  # NKI Beta 2
```

The runtime integration code lives under `tilelens/core/frontend/`. NKI
simulation runtimes live under `tilelens/core/simulation/`.

## Analysis Clients

Analyze kernels across visualization, profiling, and sanitization with a single line of code.

- Visualizer: currently supports load, store, and matmul operations for 1/2/3D tensors (more operations and dimensions coming soon).
- Profiler: flags non-unrolled loops, inefficient mask usage, and missing buffer_load optimizations while tracking load/store byte counts with low-overhead sampling.
- Sanitizer: symbolically checks tensor memory accesses for out-of-bounds errors and emits reports with tensor metadata, call stack, and expression trees; optional fake-memory storage avoids real reads.

### Save and load traces

```py
import tilelens

tilelens.save("trace.tvz")
tilelens.load(
    "trace.tvz"
)  # automatically clears out existing records, use kwarg "append=True" to prevent this
tilelens.launch()
```

CLI: `tile-visualizer trace.tvz`. The archive is a zip file containing `manifest.json` plus `tensors.npz`, and `tilelens.load(...)` restores the normal trace state for existing consumers.


### Environment variables

TileLens uses a small set of environment variables to configure runtime behavior. Unless noted, boolean flags are enabled only when set to `1`.

The old names `TRITON_VIZ_VERBOSE`, `TRITON_VIZ_NUM_SMS`, and `TRITON_VIZ_PORT`
still work. If both names are set, TileLens uses the `TILELENS_*` value.

- `TILELENS_VERBOSE` (default: `0`): enable verbose logging and extra debug output.
- `TILELENS_NUM_SMS` (default: `1`): number of concurrent SMs to emulate for the CPU interpreter (min 1).
- `TILELENS_PORT` (default: `8000` with `share=True`, `5001` with `share=False`): port for the Flask server.
- `ENABLE_SANITIZER` (default: `1`): enable the sanitizer pipeline that checks memory accesses.
- `ENABLE_PROFILER` (default: `1`): enable the profiler pipeline that collects performance data.
- `ENABLE_TIMING` (default: `0`): collect timing data during execution.
- `REPORT_GRID_EXECUTION_PROGRESS` (default: `0`): report per-program block execution progress in the interpreter.
- `SANITIZER_ENABLE_FAKE_TENSOR` (default: `0`): use fake tensor storage for sanitizer runs to avoid real memory reads.
- `PROFILER_ENABLE_LOAD_STORE_SKIPPING` (default: `1`): skip redundant load/store checks to reduce profiling overhead.
- `PROFILER_ENABLE_BLOCK_SAMPLING` (default: `1`): sample a subset of blocks to reduce profiling overhead.
- `PROFILER_DISABLE_BUFFER_LOAD_CHECK` (default: `0`): disable buffer load checks in the profiler.

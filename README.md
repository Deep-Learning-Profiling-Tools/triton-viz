## About

TileLens helps developers inspect Triton kernels with visualization, profiling, and memory-safety analysis tools. It can run many examples through Triton's interpreter, so GPU access is not required for basic debugging workflows.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python >= 3.10


### Installation of TileLens

> **Windows Note:** TileLens depends on Triton, which can only be installed on Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). Once installed, follow below instructions in WSL.

Install TileLens from PyPI:

```sh
pip install tilelens
```

If you want to run examples from this repo, contribute, or build the web UI, install from source instead:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Deep-Learning-Profiling-Tools/tilelens.git
cd tilelens
uv sync # or "uv sync --extra test" if you're running tests
```

### Transitioning from Triton-viz to TileLens

The GitHub repo and PyPI package are now named `tilelens`. Use `import tilelens`
in new code. Old `triton_viz` imports, including submodule imports, still work.

If you already have `triton-viz` installed, uninstall it before installing
TileLens. The two packages share files, so keeping both installed can break
imports and CLI commands:

```sh
pip uninstall -y triton-viz
pip install tilelens
```

For source installs, use `pip install .` after uninstalling the old package.
If you already installed both, uninstall `triton-viz` first, then run
`pip install --force-reinstall --no-deps tilelens` (or
`pip install --force-reinstall --no-deps .` from this repo). This restores the
shared files without reinstalling or upgrading dependencies such as Triton.
Restart Python or your notebook kernel after upgrading.

Existing `.tvz` traces can still be loaded with `tilelens.load(...)`.
Traces saved by TileLens cannot be loaded by older Triton-Viz versions.

CLI commands are `tile-sanitizer`, `tile-profiler`, `tile-race`, and `tile-visualizer`.
The old `triton-sanitizer`, `triton-profiler`, `triton-race-detector`, and
`triton-visualizer` commands still work.

### Web UI Build

The PyPI package ships with prebuilt web UI assets in `tilelens/static`, so
you do not need npm to run the visualizer. If you want to modify the web UI,
rebuild the TS sources:

```sh
npm install
npm run build:frontend
```

### Optional: Enable NKI Support

For PyPI installs, install with the `nki` extra and AWS Neuron repository:

```sh
pip install "tilelens[nki]" --extra-index-url https://pip.repos.neuron.amazonaws.com
```

For source installs:

```sh
uv sync --extra nki # or "uv sync --extra nki --extra test" if also running NKI-related tests
```

Note that you need to specify all features that you want _in one statement_ when using `uv sync`, i.e. if you want both NKI and testing support, you must run `uv sync --extra nki --extra test`. The below statements are wrong and will remove the NKI install when installing test packages:
```
uv sync --extra nki # NKI support but no testing
uv sync --extra test # tests but no NKI support
```

### Testing
* To run core TileLens tests, run `pytest tests/`.
* (if NKI installed) To run NKI-specific tests, run `pytest tests/ -m nki`.
* To run all tests (Triton + NKI), run `pytest tests/ -m ""`.
* On a Triton release outside the tested window of the compiled sanitizer
  (`tilelens.core.config.TESTED_TRITON_VERSIONS`), its IR-mode tests (marked
  `ir_mode`, see `tests/conftest.py`) are skipped, saying why; the version-gate
  tests (`tests/unit/test_ir_version_gate.py`) still run. Set
  `TILELENS_IR_ALLOW_UNTESTED_TRITON=1` to run them all, e.g. to validate a new
  release before adding it to the window.
* To run visualizer web UI tests, run `npm run test:frontend`.

## Working with Examples

Run an example directly with Python:

```sh
python examples/visualizer/matmul.py
```

Use the decorator API when writing or modifying a Triton kernel:

```py
import triton
import triton.language as tl
import tilelens


@tilelens.trace("sanitizer")  # also supports "tracer" and "profiler"
@triton.jit
def kernel(x_ptr, out_ptr, BLOCK: tl.constexpr):
    offsets = tl.arange(0, BLOCK)
    values = tl.load(x_ptr + offsets)
    tl.store(out_ptr + offsets, values)
```

Use the CLI wrappers to run an existing Python script without editing it. These
wrappers patch plain `@triton.jit` kernels, so use them with scripts that do not
already apply `@tilelens.trace(...)`.

```sh
tile-sanitizer examples/sanitizer/oob_cli.py
tile-profiler examples/profiler/load_store_cli.py
tile-visualizer trace.tvz
```

For visualizer workflows, save a trace and launch the UI from Python:

```py
import tilelens

tilelens.save("trace.tvz")
tilelens.launch()
```

## DSL Frontends

Triton is the default DSL frontend. NKI support is optional and selected with
the `frontend` argument:

```py
tilelens.trace("tracer")  # Triton
tilelens.trace("tracer", frontend="nki")  # NKI
tilelens.trace("tracer", frontend="nki_beta2")  # NKI Beta 2
```

The runtime integration code lives under `tilelens/core/frontend/`. NKI
simulation runtimes live under `tilelens/core/simulation/`.

## Analysis Clients

Analyze kernels across visualization, profiling, and sanitization with a single line of code.

- Visualizer: currently supports load, store, and matmul operations for 1/2/3D tensors (more operations and dimensions coming soon).
- Profiler: flags non-unrolled loops, inefficient mask usage, and missing buffer_load optimizations while tracking load/store byte counts with low-overhead sampling.
- Sanitizer: symbolically checks tensor memory accesses for out-of-bounds errors and emits reports with tensor metadata, call stack, and expression trees; optional fake-memory storage avoids real reads.

### Compiled sanitizer

`Sanitizer(compile=True)` checks each launch against the kernel Triton compiles
for it (its TTIR) instead of interpreting it: out-of-bounds accesses (against the
tensor's view, strides included), integer-width overflows in address, mask and
branch arithmetic, and divisions by zero, each with a witness (program ids, lanes,
loop iteration). The kernel is compiled on the host, exactly as the JIT would
compile the launch but only through the TTIR stage (through the whole pipeline
under `TRITON_KERNEL_DUMP`, `TRITON_KERNEL_OVERRIDE` or `USE_IR_LOC`), so **no GPU
is needed**: CPU tensors work, and so does a machine without a driver. From the
CLI, give the flag before the script name (the legacy `triton-sanitizer` alias
takes it too):

```sh
tile-sanitizer --compile my_script.py --my-script-flag
```

```py
from tilelens.clients import Sanitizer


@tilelens.trace(Sanitizer(compile=True))
@triton.jit
def kernel(x_ptr, n, BLOCK: tl.constexpr):
    ...
```

- Kernels are compiled and checked, **not run**: their outputs are never written,
  so a script that checks its own results fails under `--compile`, and a launch
  whose arguments the script computes from an earlier kernel's output is checked
  with those unwritten values.
- Kernels are compiled for a fixed target, `cuda:89` (sm89, e.g. RTX 4090) by
  default, so a verdict does not depend on the machine it was computed on.
  Choose another with `Sanitizer(compile=True, target="cuda:90")` (or
  `"hip:gfx942"`, or a Triton `GPUTarget`), or for every client that names none
  with the environment variable `TILELENS_IR_TARGET=cuda:90` (e.g. for
  `tile-sanitizer --compile`). The kernel's
  own target queries (`tl.target_info.is_cuda()`, `cuda_capability_geq()`,
  `is_hip()`) answer for that target too, and `TRITON_OVERRIDE_ARCH` does not
  apply: the target is the one named. The TTIR can differ between targets (e.g.
  tensor descriptors, target-dependent branches), and a verdict holds for the
  target it was checked for. To check a launch for several targets, stack one
  sanitizer per target (`@tilelens.trace(Sanitizer(compile=True,
  target="cuda:90"))` over `@tilelens.trace(Sanitizer(compile=True,
  target="cuda:80"))`): each keeps its own verdict (`last_verdict`), and the
  launch's records hold them in trace order.
- Targets also differ in what compiles at all: `fp8e4nv` (`torch.float8_e4m3fn`,
  `tl.float8e4nv`) needs `cuda:89` or later, `num_ctas > 1` and 16-bit tensor
  descriptor atomic min/max need `cuda:90`. A kernel or autotune config that fails
  to compile for the target never stops the script (it was not going to run
  anyway): it is reported `unsupported`, kind `compile-failed`, naming the target
  and how to choose another, since it may run on a GPU of another kind unchecked.
  Name a target it compiles for to check it. Only a failure no target compiles
  past (a failing `tl.static_assert`, or a Python construct Triton never compiles,
  unless the kernel asked Triton's driver anything first, e.g. through
  `tl.target_info` or a device query it catches, or an earlier compile of the
  kernel for the target did) is just a note in the verdict: that config never
  launches (the autotuner skips it too). A target answer the kernel's own code
  keeps from outside the check (another trace or target, the untraced program)
  and never asks for again cannot be seen. A launch none of whose configs
  compiled is `unsupported` (`compile-failed`), and its notes are printed with
  it. Each report names where the kernel failed (`file:line`) and the innermost
  error in one line.
- A call that does not match the kernel's signature (a missing, extra or
  misnamed argument), or that Triton cannot key (e.g. an unhashable constexpr
  value), is a bug in the call, not a compile failure: it raises the very
  `TypeError` the untraced call raises, on any GPU, and the script stops there
  (under `tile-sanitizer --compile` with a traceback and exit status 1). So does
  a trace that also interprets the kernel (e.g. with the `Tracer`), before the
  interpreter runs, which would fail on the call too. An autotuned call that
  passes an autotuned meta-parameter itself raises the autotuner's own
  `Conflicting meta-parameters` `ValueError`. A keyword that names no parameter
  is a compile option, which the target may not know (e.g. `waves_per_eu`, a
  HIP option, under a CUDA target): that is the target's `compile-failed`, and
  the report names the keyword (misspelled, it fails on every GPU untraced too).
  All of this holds on a tested Triton release (below), or with the override:
  on another release nothing is compiled, so nothing binds the call, and the
  launch is `unsupported` (`untested-triton-version`), a call that does not
  bind included (a trace that also interprets the kernel raises the
  interpreter's own error for it).
- Each launch gets an `IRVerdict` in its records: `ok` is a proof for that
  launch's scalar arguments, grid and tensors (`scope="launch"`); `violations`
  comes with the findings; `unsupported` names what was not checked (e.g. a
  data-dependent address, a construct the TTIR reader does not model, a Z3
  query that timed out, which can depend on the machine's load, a config that
  failed to compile for the target, `compile-failed`, or a compile the host
  cannot run, `host-compile-unavailable`). An autotuned
  launch checks every config, each with its own arguments and grid and with a
  `ConfigVerdict` of its own, also when several configs compile to one kernel.
- With the default `abort_on_error=True` the findings are printed and the
  process exits with status 1; `ENABLE_SANITIZER=0` leaves kernels untraced.
- Tested on Triton 3.6 and 3.8; on another release every launch is
  `unsupported` (`untested-triton-version`), nothing compiled, unless
  `TILELENS_IR_ALLOW_UNTESTED_TRITON=1` is set.

### Save and load traces

```py
import tilelens

tilelens.save("trace.tvz")
tilelens.load(
    "trace.tvz"
)  # automatically clears out existing records, use kwarg "append=True" to prevent this
tilelens.launch()
```

CLI: `tile-visualizer trace.tvz`. The archive is a zip file containing `manifest.json` plus `tensors.npz`, and `tilelens.load(...)` restores the normal trace state for existing consumers.


### Environment variables

TileLens uses a small set of environment variables to configure runtime behavior. Unless noted, boolean flags are enabled only when set to `1`.

The old names `TRITON_VIZ_VERBOSE`, `TRITON_VIZ_NUM_SMS`, and `TRITON_VIZ_PORT`
still work. If both names are set, TileLens uses the `TILELENS_*` value.

- `TILELENS_VERBOSE` (default: `0`): enable verbose logging and extra debug output.
- `TILELENS_NUM_SMS` (default: `1`): number of concurrent SMs to emulate for the CPU interpreter (min 1).
- `TILELENS_PORT` (default: `8000` with `share=True`, `5001` with `share=False`): port for the Flask server.
- `ENABLE_SANITIZER` (default: `1`): enable the sanitizer pipeline that checks memory accesses.
- `ENABLE_PROFILER` (default: `1`): enable the profiler pipeline that collects performance data.
- `ENABLE_TIMING` (default: `0`): collect timing data during execution.
- `REPORT_GRID_EXECUTION_PROGRESS` (default: `0`): report per-program block execution progress in the interpreter.
- `SANITIZER_ENABLE_FAKE_TENSOR` (default: `0`): use fake tensor storage for sanitizer runs to avoid real memory reads.
- `PROFILER_ENABLE_LOAD_STORE_SKIPPING` (default: `1`): skip redundant load/store checks to reduce profiling overhead.
- `PROFILER_ENABLE_BLOCK_SAMPLING` (default: `1`): sample a subset of blocks to reduce profiling overhead.
- `PROFILER_DISABLE_BUFFER_LOAD_CHECK` (default: `0`): disable buffer load checks in the profiler.
